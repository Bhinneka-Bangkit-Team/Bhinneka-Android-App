## About Selaras
Selaras is a sign language interpreter mobile app, specially tailored to serve the needs of the deaf and HoH community in Indonesia. Selaras have real time sign language interpreter, so that our user can relay their communication well. This is very suitable in a condition where the user can communicate with their close friend, family, or anyone they're comfortable with as long as the user is in a situation where  they can use both hands to do the sign language. When a sentence is successfully constructed, it will get shown on the screen as a chat bubble and immediately get converted into speech so the other party can hear.
